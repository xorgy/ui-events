Bridges X11 input into the [`ui-events`] model.

Input goes through XInput 2 and XKB.
There is no core-protocol fallback.
The crate owns no connection: select XInput 2 events, pump the queue, and
pass each decoded [`x11rb` event] to the [`keyboard`], [`pointer`],
[`touch`], and [`gesture`] reducers.
Pointer, touch, and gesture take a scale factor and a monotonic nanosecond
timestamp in the host clock.
[`mapping`] holds the plain-value conversions.

Physical key codes need no system library.
The `xkb` feature links `libxkbcommon` (via [`ui-events-xkb`]) for logical
keys, text, and full modifier state from a keymap.

`x11rb` defaults to pure-Rust [`RustConnection`].
The `xcb` feature switches to [`XCBConnection`] for sharing an existing XCB
connection; `dl-libxcb` loads `libxcb` at run time.

## Minimum supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This version of UI Events X11 has been verified to compile with **Rust 1.85** and later.

Future versions of UI Events X11 might increase the Rust version requirement.
It will not be treated as a breaking change and as such can even happen with small patch releases.

<summary>Click here if compiling fails.</summary>

As time has passed, some of UI Events X11's dependencies could have released versions with a higher Rust requirement.
If you encounter a compilation issue due to a dependency and don't want to upgrade your Rust toolchain, then you could downgrade the dependency.

```sh
# Use the problematic dependency's name and version
cargo update -p package_name --precise 0.1.1
```
