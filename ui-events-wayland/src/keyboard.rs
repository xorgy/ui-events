//! Reduces `wl_keyboard` event streams into [`KeyboardEvent`]s.
//!
//! [`KeyboardEventReducer`] mirrors the stateful-reducer pattern of the other
//! adapters: feed it each `wl_keyboard` event for a seat's keyboard and it
//! tracks the focused keyboard state, returning a [`KeyboardEvent`] for each key
//! press and release.
//!
//! ## Physical keys without a keymap
//!
//! This reducer resolves the *physical* key. Each key's evdev scancode is mapped
//! to its W3C [`Code`] through [`mapping::code_from_evdev_scancode`], and the key
//! state to [`KeyState::Down`] or [`KeyState::Up`]. The `repeated` key state
//! added in `wl_keyboard` version 10 is reported as a [`KeyState::Down`] with the
//! event's `repeat` flag set; the reducer does not otherwise synthesize repeats.
//!
//! The *logical* key value depends on the active layout, dead keys, and
//! composition, all of which need the keymap, so the [`KeyboardEvent`]'s `key` is
//! [`Key::Named`]\([`NamedKey::Unidentified`]) and its `location` is
//! [`Location::Standard`] in this tier. Resolving them, and typed text, is the
//! job of the `xkb` feature described below.
//!
//! ## Logical keys with the `xkb` feature
//!
//! Enabling the `xkb` feature links `libxkbcommon` and resolves the logical key
//! from the compositor's keymap. The `keymap` event compiles an XKB keymap; each
//! key's scancode (offset by `8` to its xkb keycode) is then translated to a
//! [`Key`] — a [`Key::Character`] carrying the typed text, or a [`Key::Named`]
//! for an action key — and the [`KeyboardEvent`]'s `location` is derived from its
//! physical [`Code`]. Until a `keymap` event arrives, the keymap-less behavior
//! above still applies.
//!
//! ## Modifiers
//!
//! Without the keymap the `wl_keyboard` `modifiers` event is an opaque bitmask,
//! so the reducer ignores it and instead tracks the physical modifier keys it
//! sees pressed and released — Control, Alt, Shift, and Meta, by their
//! layout-independent [`Code`]s — assembling the modifier set through
//! [`mapping::modifiers_from_bools`]. A modifier stays active while either its
//! left or right key is held. The lock states (Caps Lock, Num Lock) and the
//! Alt Graph distinction are defined by the keymap, so with the `xkb` feature
//! the keymap interprets the `modifiers` event directly and yields the
//! authoritative set including those lock states and Alt Graph.
//!
//! ## Focus and repeat
//!
//! A focus `enter` lists the keys already logically down; the reducer seeds its
//! pressed-key state from them so the modifier set is correct from the first
//! event, but emits nothing (the protocol advises against emulating presses from
//! that list). A `leave` clears the state. The `keymap` event is used only under
//! the `xkb` feature, and the `repeat_info` parameters are surfaced through
//! [`KeyboardEventReducer::repeat_info`] for a consumer that drives key repeat.
